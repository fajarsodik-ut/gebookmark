## 📝 Important Notes

### ⚠️ Backend API (worker folder)

The `worker/` folder contains Cloudflare Workers code that **won't be deployed** to Netlify. This is fine because:

- The app works entirely **client-side**
- All data is stored in **browser localStorage**
- No backend is needed for basic functionality

If you need backend features later:

- Use **Netlify Functions** (serverless functions)
- Use an external API service
- Use Firebase/Supabase for data storage

### 📦 Dependencies

- Kept all dependencies for compatibility
- Cloudflare packages won't affect the build (they're just not used)
- Can be removed later if you want to clean up
